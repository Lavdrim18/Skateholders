text about this paper.
This paper focuses on the notion of social impact measurement for social enterprises (SEs) and supports the multiple-constituency approach[1] as the most appropriate solution for adopting different metrics in relation to the growing number of social impact measurements. This topic is part of a broader debate concerning the demand for “accountability” expressed by civil society in the form of citizens and customers, which, since the early 1990s, has dominated the arena of scientific research. In recent years, the debate regarding the “accountability mechanism” of SEs has moved to the “mantra” of social impact and social impact measurement, which has drawn attention from both academia and practitioners (Arena et al., 2015; Ebrahim and Rangan, 2010). Funders and taxpayers, in particular, demand the measurement of the social impact of non-profit organisations to obtain a level of disclosure which allows the organisations to provide the information about their use of resources and funds (Ebrahim and Weisband, 2007; Kearns, 1996).
